# FINAL SOLUTION: Push Clean Project to GitHub

## Problem Identified
The security violations are caused by actual OAuth credentials in these files:
- `credentials.json` - Contains Google Client ID and Secret
- `token.json` - Contains OAuth tokens and credentials

## Complete Solution: Run These Commands in Shell

### 1. Remove Git history completely
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

### 2. Remove OAuth credential files (they're already in .gitignore but were tracked)
```bash
# These files contain the actual secrets GitHub is blocking
rm credentials.json
rm token.json
# Keep .gitignore entry to prevent future tracking
```

### 3. Initialize fresh repository
```bash
git init
git config user.email "hbach1810@gmail.com"
git config user.name "dai-vu-tien-sinh"
```

### 4. Add all files (OAuth files now excluded)
```bash
git add .
```

### 5. Verify no secrets in staged files
```bash
git status
# Should NOT show credentials.json or token.json
echo "Checking for secrets..."
grep -r "250486741229" . 2>/dev/null && echo "❌ Found Client ID" || echo "✅ No Client ID"
grep -r "GOCSPX-" . 2>/dev/null && echo "❌ Found Client Secret" || echo "✅ No Client Secret"
```

### 6. Commit clean project
```bash
git commit -m "Complete Làng Hữu Nghị management system

✅ Vietnamese educational facility management platform
✅ Streamlit web application with role-based access control
✅ SQLite database (lang_huu_nghi.db) with 107 student records
✅ Document attachment system with 4 sample files for Nguyễn Văn Học
✅ Medical records, class management, and statistics features
✅ Google Drive backup integration (OAuth setup via environment variables)
✅ Multi-house support (T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, N02)
✅ Comprehensive Word report generation with separate document export
✅ Security-compliant: No hardcoded credentials, uses environment variables
✅ Ready for deployment with proper OAuth configuration"
```

### 7. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## What Will Be Pushed:
✅ Complete source code (all Python files, Streamlit configuration)
✅ Database: `lang_huu_nghi.db` (485KB) with 107 students and 4 documents
✅ Documentation: README.md, deployment guides, security instructions
✅ Clean OAuth setup using environment variables only
✅ NO sensitive credential files

## Post-Deployment OAuth Setup:
After successful push, follow `SECURITY_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to:
1. Create new Google Cloud OAuth credentials for your deployment
2. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
3. Upload `credentials.json` directly to your deployment (not via Git)

This approach ensures GitHub security compliance while preserving all functionality.
