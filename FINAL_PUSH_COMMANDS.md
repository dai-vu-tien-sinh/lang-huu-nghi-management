# Final Commands to Push to GitHub

The issue was that `.gitignore` was excluding your database file. I've fixed this. Now run these commands in the Shell:

## 1. Kill any running Git processes and clear locks:
```bash
killall git 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock
```

## 2. Add and commit all files (including database):
```bash
git add .
git status
# You should now see lang_huu_nghi.db in the staged files
```

## 3. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Add complete Làng Hữu Nghị system with database

- Complete Vietnamese management system for educational facility
- Database file lang_huu_nghi.db (485KB) with 107 students  
- Document attachments for Nguyễn Văn Học (4 files)
- Role-based access control system
- Medical records and class management
- Statistics and reporting features
- Fixed .gitignore to include database file"
```

## 4. Push to GitHub (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):
```bash
git push https://ghp_YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management.git main --force
```

## Alternative if that fails:
```bash
# Create fresh repository
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Làng Hữu Nghị management system with database"
git remote add origin https://ghp_YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## What's now included:
✅ Complete source code
✅ Database file `lang_huu_nghi.db` (485KB)  
✅ 107 student records
✅ 4 document attachments
✅ All configuration files
✅ Vietnamese documentation

The database file will now be included in the repository for deployment purposes.
