# Fix Corrupted Git Repository and Push to GitHub

The Git repository is corrupted. Here's how to fix it and push your complete project with database:

## Step 1: Remove corrupted Git repository
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

## Step 2: Initialize fresh Git repository
```bash
git init
git config user.email "hbach1810@gmail.com"
git config user.name "dai-vu-tien-sinh"
```

## Step 3: Add all files (including database)
```bash
git add .
```

## Step 4: Verify database is included
```bash
git status
# You should see lang_huu_nghi.db in the list
ls -la lang_huu_nghi.db
# Should show: -rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 495616 Jul 20 07:55 lang_huu_nghi.db
```

## Step 5: Commit everything
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Làng Hữu Nghị management system

- Vietnamese educational facility management system
- Complete Streamlit web application with role-based access
- SQLite database (lang_huu_nghi.db) with 107 students
- Document attachment system with 4 files for Nguyễn Văn Học
- Medical records, class management, statistics features
- Google Drive backup integration
- Multi-house support (T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, N02)
- Comprehensive Word report generation with separate document export"
```

## Step 6: Add remote and push
```bash
git remote add origin https://ghp_YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## What will be pushed:
✅ Complete source code (Python, Streamlit)
✅ Database: lang_huu_nghi.db (485KB) 
✅ 107 student records with complete profiles
✅ 4 document attachments for Nguyễn Văn Học
✅ Medical records and class management
✅ Vietnamese documentation (README.md)
✅ All configuration files for deployment

## Verify success:
After pushing, check:
1. Go to https://github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management
2. Confirm lang_huu_nghi.db file is present (485KB)
3. Check README.md displays correctly
4. Verify all source files are there

This will create a clean repository with your complete project and database ready for deployment.
