# Fix OAuth Verification Error 403: access_denied

## Problem
"Làng Hữu Nghị Database Backup has not completed the Google verification process"

## Root Cause
Your Google Cloud OAuth app is in **Testing** mode, which restricts access to only developer-approved test users.

## Solution 1: Add Test User (Recommended - Takes 1 minute)

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. **Select your project**: "lang-huu-nghi-backup"
3. **OAuth consent screen** tab
4. **Scroll down** to "Test users" section
5. **Click "+ ADD USERS"** 
6. **Add email**: `langtrehuunghivietnam@gmail.com`
7. **Save**

✅ **Result**: OAuth Playground will work immediately for this email!

## Solution 2: Publish App (Takes longer - Google review)

1. **In OAuth consent screen**
2. **Click "PUBLISH APP"** button
3. **Submit for verification** (may take several days for Google review)

## Solution 3: Internal Use Only

1. **Change User Type** from "External" to "Internal"
2. **Only works** if you have a Google Workspace organization
3. **Limits access** to your organization members only

## Verification Status

- **Testing**: Only test users can access (current status)
- **In production**: Needs Google verification for external users
- **Published**: Available to all users after Google approval

## Quick Fix Steps

**Most users should use Solution 1:**
1. Console → OAuth consent screen
2. Test users → Add users  
3. Add your email
4. Try OAuth Playground again

**This takes less than 1 minute and solves the problem immediately.**
