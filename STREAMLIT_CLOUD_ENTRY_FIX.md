# Streamlit Cloud Entry Point Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Streamlit Cloud was showing "streamlit app" instead of your Vietnamese homepage
- The entry point wasn't properly executing the main application

## Solution Applied
Updated `streamlit_app.py` to:
- Directly execute `Trang_chủ.py` content
- Show Vietnamese error messages if loading fails
- Include debugging information for troubleshooting
- Properly handle file execution in cloud environment

## Next Steps
Push this fix to GitHub for automatic redeployment:

```bash
# Clear any Git locks
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock

# Add and commit the fix
git add streamlit_app.py
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud entry point - resolve homepage loading issue"

# Push with your token
git push https://ghp_YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/dai-vu-tien-sinh/lang-huu-nghi-management.git main
```

## Expected Result
After pushing:
1. Streamlit Cloud automatically detects the change
2. Redeploys your application within 2-3 minutes
3. Your Vietnamese homepage "Hệ thống quản lý dữ liệu Làng Hữu Nghị" loads correctly
4. Login screen appears in Vietnamese
5. Full functionality restored

Your app will show the proper Vietnamese management system interface instead of a generic Streamlit page!
