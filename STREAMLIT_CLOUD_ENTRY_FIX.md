# Streamlit Cloud Entry Point Fix

## Issue
Streamlit Cloud was trying to run `streamlit_app.py` which imported from non-existent `main.py`, causing ModuleNotFoundError.

## Root Cause
- Streamlit Cloud defaults to looking for `streamlit_app.py` as entry point
- Our main application is actually in `Trang_chủ.py` (Vietnamese homepage)
- The import `from main import main` was incorrect

## Solution Applied
Updated `streamlit_app.py` to properly import and execute `Trang_chủ.py`:
- Uses `importlib.util` to dynamically load the Vietnamese homepage
- Maintains proper module loading for Streamlit Cloud
- Preserves all functionality of the original application

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Update Streamlit Cloud Configuration
In Streamlit Cloud dashboard, set main file path to: `Trang_chủ.py`

### Option 2: Keep Current Fix
The updated `streamlit_app.py` will work correctly as entry point.

## Expected Result
- Streamlit Cloud will successfully load the application
- All Vietnamese interface and functionality preserved
- Database connection and authentication working
- No more ModuleNotFoundError

## Next Steps
After pushing this fix:
1. Streamlit Cloud will auto-redeploy
2. App should load successfully at your Streamlit Cloud URL
3. Test login with admin/admin123
4. Verify all features work correctly

The Vietnamese educational management system should now be fully functional on Streamlit Cloud.
